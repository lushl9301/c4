[ ![Codeship Status for lushl9301/c4](https://codeship.com/projects/a3548480-5425-0132-8879-6274f9eea671/status)](https://codeship.com/projects/49121)

An exercise in minimalism.

Try the following:

    gcc -o c4 c4.c  (you may need the -m32 option on 64bit machines)
    ./c4 hello.c
    ./c4 -s hello.c
    
    ./c4 c4.c hello.c
    ./c4 c4.c c4.c hello.c
